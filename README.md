# Overview

This is a console-based Inventory Management System written in C#. The goal was to improve my understanding of key C# principles by applying them to something practical such as a tool for managing product inventories, tracking inventory numbers, and storing data between sessions.

This project provided me with hands on experience with C# syntax, object oriented design, and file management, as well as problem solving techniques such as logic and user interactions.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code on macOS, along with the .NET 9.0 SDK. I wrote the code in C#, using only standard libraries such as:

System for basic language features
System.Collections.Generic for managing product lists
System.IO for reading and writing inventory data to a file

# Future Work

There are a few features and refinements I’d like to add in the future:

Add a delete option to remove a product from inventory
Sort inventory by name, code, or quantity
